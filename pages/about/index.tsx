As a result, many organizations have used Hackathons to bring creators, developers, makers, and others together to build products. However, the organizers do not support the projects after the Hackathon, and in most cases, beginners are left out. AfricaHacks 2020 will be the first time Africa and North American creators, developers, and makers meet together to build projects with support from experts worldwide. Participants will be supported before the event, during the event, and after the event for FREE.'
